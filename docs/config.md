# Configuration

`eforge` is configured via `eforge/config.yaml` (searched upward from cwd), environment variables, and auto-discovered files.

## `eforge/config.yaml`

The `backend` field is required. All other fields are optional with defaults shown below:

```yaml

plugins:
  enabled: true               # Auto-discover Claude Code plugins
  # include:                  # Allowlist - only load these (plugin identifiers)
  # exclude:                  # Denylist - skip these from auto-discovery
  # paths:                    # Additional local plugin directories

## Model Classes

eforge assigns each agent role a **model class** that determines which model it uses by default. All roles default to `max`. Four classes exist:

| Class | Default model (claude-sdk) | Notes |
|-------|---------------------------|-------|
| `max` | `claude-opus-4-6` | All roles default to this class |
| `balanced` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Available via per-role `modelClass` override for cost optimization |
| `fast` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Available via per-role `modelClass` override for lightweight tasks |
| `auto` | (SDK default) | Lets the backend choose the model |

The Pi backend has no built-in class defaults - users must configure `agents.models.max` at minimum (and any other classes they assign to roles). The engine throws a descriptive error if no model resolves for a non-claude-sdk backend.

### Model Resolution Order

Model selection follows this priority chain (highest to lowest):

1. **Per-role `model`** - `agents.roles.<role>.model` - explicit model string for a specific role
2. **Global `model`** - `agents.model` - explicit model string for all roles
3. **User class override** - `agents.models.<class>` - custom model for the role's effective class
4. **Backend class default** - built-in model for the class (see table above)

The "effective class" for a role is determined by: per-role `modelClass` override > built-in class assignment.

```yaml
# Example: downgrade some roles to cheaper models
agents:
  models:
    balanced: claude-sonnet-4-6    # Define what 'balanced' class maps to
    fast: claude-haiku-4-5         # Define what 'fast' class maps to
  roles:
    builder:
      modelClass: balanced         # Move builder from 'max' to 'balanced' class
    formatter:
      modelClass: fast             # Move formatter to 'fast' class
    staleness-assessor:
      model: claude-haiku-4-5     # Explicit model - bypasses the class system entirely
```

## Profiles

Workflow profiles control which compile stages run. Built-in profiles (`errand`, `excursion`, `expedition`) cover the common cases - define custom profiles in `eforge/config.yaml` or via `--profiles` files to extend or override them.

```yaml
profiles:
  my-profile:
    description: "Custom workflow with extra review"
    extends: excursion          # Inherit from a built-in or other custom profile
    compile:
      - planner
      - plan-review-cycle
```

Build stages and review config are per-plan, determined by the planner during compile and stored in `orchestration.yaml` - profiles only control compile stages.

## MCP Servers

MCP servers are auto-loaded from `.mcp.json` in the project root (same format Claude Code uses). All `eforge` agents receive the same MCP servers.

## Pi Backend

Set `backend: pi` to use the Pi multi-provider backend instead of the Claude SDK. The Pi backend requires a `PI_API_KEY` environment variable (or a provider-specific API key, e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the default OpenRouter provider). Configure provider, model, and other Pi-specific settings in the `pi` section of `eforge/config.yaml`. Note: the Pi backend is experimental and untested.

## Plugins

Plugins are auto-discovered from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Both user-scoped and project-scoped plugins matching the working directory are loaded. Use `plugins.include`/`plugins.exclude` in `eforge/config.yaml` to filter, or `--no-plugins` to disable entirely.

## Hooks

Hooks are fire-and-forget shell commands triggered by `eforge` events - useful for logging, notifications, and external system integration. They do not block or influence the pipeline. See [hooks.md](hooks.md) for configuration and details.

## Config Layers

Config merges from two levels (lowest to highest priority):

1. **Global** - `~/.config/eforge/config.yaml` (respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
2. **Project** - `eforge/config.yaml` found by walking up from cwd

Object sections (`langfuse`, `agents`, `build`, `plan`, `plugins`, `prdQueue`, `daemon`, `pi`) shallow-merge per-field. `hooks` arrays concatenate (global fires first). Arrays inside objects (like `postMergeCommands`) replace rather than merge. CLI flags and environment variables override everything.

## Parallelism

eforge has three dimensions of parallelism:

### Queue processing (`prdQueue.parallelism`)

Controls the maximum number of PRDs built concurrently when processing the queue (`eforge build --queue` or `eforge queue run`). Default: `1` (sequential).

PRDs with `depends_on` frontmatter wait for their dependencies to complete before starting. If a dependency fails, all transitive dependents are marked as blocked and skipped.

CLI override: `--queue-parallelism <n>`

```yaml
prdQueue:
  parallelism: 3    # Build up to 3 PRDs concurrently
```

### Plan execution (`build.parallelism`)

Controls the maximum number of plans executed in parallel within a single build. Applies to expedition and multi-plan profiles where plans run in separate git worktrees. Default: CPU core count via `os.availableParallelism()`.

This is config-only - there is no CLI override.

```yaml
build:
  parallelism: 4    # Run up to 4 plan worktrees in parallel
```

### Enqueuing

Enqueuing is always single-threaded. The formatter processes one PRD at a time before adding it to the queue. No configuration is needed or available.
