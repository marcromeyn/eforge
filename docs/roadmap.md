# Eforge Roadmap

## Eval & Observability

**Goal**: Use evaluation data and runtime observability to drive evidence-based improvement of workflow profiles and agent behavior.

- **Code quality metrics** — Add static analysis metrics (complexity, duplication, lint violations) to the eval harness so profile tuning goes beyond pass/fail, tokens, and cost
- **Comparative profile tuning** — Run profiles head-to-head on the same PRDs and use outcome data (including code quality) to refine profiles from intuition toward evidence
- **Acceptance coverage gaps** — Detect PRD requirements that lack corresponding test cases and flag builds where acceptance coverage is incomplete

---

## Daemon & MCP Server

**Goal**: Extend the daemon as the single orchestration authority with richer controls and safety checks.

- **Queue reordering & priority** — Web UI and MCP controls for reordering queued PRDs and setting build priority
- **Re-guidance** — Build interruption with amended context, daemon-to-worker IPC for mid-build guidance changes
- **Plugin–engine version compatibility** — Add `version` to the daemon health endpoint and `minEngineVersion` to plugin.json. The MCP proxy checks compatibility at startup and warns (or refuses) if the installed eforge version is too old for the plugin.

## Multimodal Input

**Goal**: Let users attach images and PDFs alongside text to give agents richer context - wireframes, bug screenshots, design specs.

- **CLI `--attach` support** - Accept image/PDF file paths on `eforge run` and `eforge enqueue`, save to temp dir, inject prompt hints so planner and builder agents read them
- **Queue attachment storage** - Companion directory alongside PRD files so attachments persist through enqueue-then-run workflows
- **Plugin skill forwarding** - Update `/eforge:run` and `/eforge:enqueue` skills to accept and forward `--attach` arguments

---

## Integration & Maturity

**Goal**: Full lifecycle coverage, CI support, provider flexibility.

- **OpenRouter backend** — `AgentBackend` implementation using the `openai` npm package pointed at OpenRouter's API, unlocking 400+ models (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.) as the second provider. Requires a self-managed agent loop and tool executors since OpenRouter is a chat completion API, not an agentic framework.
- **Monorepo** — Extend pnpm workspaces (currently only monitor UI) so the engine, eval harness, eforge-plugin, and marketing site each get their own package with isolated deps and build configs

---

## Marketing Site (eforge.run)

**Goal**: Public-facing site for docs, demos, and project visibility.

- **Next.js app** — `web/` directory, deployed to Vercel at eforge.run
- **Landing page** — Value prop, feature overview, getting-started guide
- **Documentation** — Usage docs, configuration reference, examples
