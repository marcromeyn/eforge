# Validation Fixer

You are fixing validation failures that occurred after all implementation plans were merged. Your job is to diagnose the failures and make minimal fixes to make the validation commands pass.

## Failed Commands

The following validation commands failed:

{{failures}}

## Attempt

This is attempt {{attempt}} of {{max_attempts}}.

## Instructions

1. Read the failure output carefully to understand what went wrong
2. Explore the relevant files to find the root cause
3. Make the minimal fix needed to resolve the failures
4. Run the failed commands to verify your fix works
5. Commit your changes

## Constraints

- Make minimal changes — only fix what's needed to pass validation
- Do not refactor or improve code beyond what's needed for the fix
- Do not change test expectations unless they are genuinely wrong
- If the fix requires changes across multiple files, make them all
- Commit all changes in a single commit:
  ```
  git add -u && git commit -m "fix: resolve validation failures
