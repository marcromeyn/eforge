# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is this?

eforge is a standalone CLI tool that extracts plan-build-review workflows from the schaake-cc-marketplace Claude Code plugins into a portable TypeScript library + CLI built on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. It runs outside Claude Code as an independent developer tool.

The architecture is **library-first**: a pure, event-driven engine (`src/engine/`) that yields typed `EforgeEvent`s via `AsyncGenerator`, consumed by thin surface layers (CLI today, Claude Code plugin and headless/CI in the future).

**Engine vs plugin boundary**: The engine handles everything that runs without Claude Code (plan generation, review cycles, build execution, orchestration, state, monitoring, tracing). The plugin is a thin launcher/facilitator — requirement refinement in conversation context, subprocess delegation, status rendering. Not a reimplementation.

**Relationship to orchestrate & EEE plugins**: eforge is a graduated replacement. The eforge plugin will supersede both for planning and execution, eventually deprecating them entirely.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build        # Bundle with tsup → dist/cli.js
pnpm dev          # Run directly via tsx (e.g. pnpm dev -- plan foo.md)
pnpm test             # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm test:watch       # Watch mode
pnpm type-check   # Type check without emitting

# Run with Langfuse tracing (dev)
pnpm dev:trace -- plan docs/init-prd.md --verbose
# Run built CLI with Langfuse tracing
node --env-file=.env dist/cli.js plan docs/init-prd.md --verbose
```

## Architecture

**Design principle**: Engine emits, consumers render. The engine never writes to stdout — all communication flows through `EforgeEvent`s.

**Agent loop**: planner → plan-reviewer → plan-evaluator → builder → reviewer → evaluator, each consuming the `AgentBackend` interface. Planning and building both use a shared `runReviewCycle()` for the review→evaluate pattern.

**Backend abstraction**: Agent runners never import the AI SDK directly. All LLM interaction goes through the `AgentBackend` interface (`src/engine/backend.ts`). The sole SDK adapter lives in `src/engine/backends/claude-sdk.ts`. New agents must accept an `AgentBackend` via their options — do not import `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` outside of `src/engine/backends/`.

**MCP server propagation**: The engine auto-loads MCP servers from `.mcp.json` in the project root (same file Claude Code uses). All agents get the same MCP servers — no per-role filtering. MCP config is backend-specific: `ClaudeSDKBackend` accepts optional `mcpServers` in its constructor, and `EforgeEngineOptions.mcpServers` lets callers inject servers programmatically (overrides auto-loading). The `AgentBackend` interface has no MCP concept. Note: SDK subprocesses do NOT auto-discover MCP servers from settings files — explicit propagation is required.

**Plugin propagation**: The engine auto-discovers Claude Code plugins from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Both user-scoped (global) and project-scoped plugins matching the cwd are loaded. Plugins provide skills, hooks, and MCP servers. Like MCP servers, plugins are backend-specific: `ClaudeSDKBackend` accepts `plugins` and `settingSources` in its constructor. The `AgentBackend` interface has no plugin concept. Configure via `eforge.yaml` `plugins` section or `--no-plugins` CLI flag.

- **Planner** — one-shot query. Explores codebase, assesses scope, writes plan files (YAML frontmatter format). Outputs `<clarification>` XML blocks for ambiguities. For expeditions, also generates architecture + module list.
- **Plan Reviewer** — one-shot query. Blind review of plan files against PRD for cohesion, completeness, correctness. Leaves fixes unstaged.
- **Plan Evaluator** — one-shot query. Evaluates plan reviewer's unstaged fixes against planner's intent. Accepts/rejects.
- **Module Planner** — one-shot query (expedition mode only). Writes detailed plan for a single module using architecture context.
- **Builder** — multi-turn agent. Turn 1: implement plan. Turn 2: evaluate reviewer's unstaged fixes (accept/reject/review).
- **Reviewer** — one-shot query. Blind code review (no builder context), leaves fixes unstaged.
- **Validation Fixer** — one-shot coding agent. Receives post-merge validation failures and makes minimal fixes.

**Engine** (`src/engine/`): Pure library, no stdout. Agent implementations in `src/engine/agents/`, prompts in `src/engine/prompts/` (self-contained `.md` files, no runtime plugin dependencies).

**Orchestration**: `src/engine/orchestrator.ts` resolves a dependency graph from `orchestration.yaml`, computes execution waves, and runs plans in parallel via git worktrees (`src/engine/worktree.ts`). Worktrees live in a sibling directory (`../{project}-{set}-worktrees/`) to avoid CLAUDE.md context pollution. Branches merge in topological order after all plans complete. Post-merge validation runs commands from `orchestration.yaml` `validate` (planner-generated) + `eforge.yaml` `postMergeCommands` (user-configured). On failure, the validation fixer agent attempts repairs up to `maxValidationRetries` times (default 2).

**State**: `.eforge/state.json` (gitignored) tracks build progress for resume support.

**Monitor** (`src/monitor/`): Web-based real-time monitor. Records all `EforgeEvent`s to SQLite (`.eforge/monitor.db`) via a transparent `withRecording()` async generator middleware. Serves a single-page dashboard over SSE at `http://localhost:4567`. Auto-starts with `plan`, `build`, and `run` commands (disable with `--no-monitor`).

**CLI** (`src/cli/`): Thin consumer that iterates the engine's event stream and renders to stdout. Handles interactive clarification prompts and approval gates via callbacks.

## Testing

Tests live in `test/` and use vitest. Organize by **logical unit**, not source file:

- **Group by what's tested, not where it lives.** A source file may split across multiple test files (e.g., `plan.ts` → `dependency-graph.test.ts` + `plan-parsing.test.ts`) or multiple source files may merge into one test file (e.g., XML parsers from `common.ts`, `reviewer.ts`, `builder.ts` → `xml-parsers.test.ts`).
- **No mocks.** Test real code. For SDK types, hand-craft data objects cast through `unknown` rather than mocking.
- **Fixtures for I/O tests only.** File-reading tests use `test/fixtures/`; everything else constructs inputs inline.
- **Helpers colocated.** Test helpers (e.g., `makeState()`, `asyncIterableFrom()`) live in the test file that uses them. No shared test utils unless reuse spans 3+ files.
- **Agent wiring tests use `StubBackend`** (`test/stub-backend.ts`). Test the logic between backend calls and EforgeEvents: clarification loops, XML parsing → event synthesis, error propagation. See `test/agent-wiring.test.ts`.
- **Don't test backend implementations or infra.** `ClaudeSDKBackend`, `EforgeEngine` orchestration, worktree/git ops, and tracing are integration-level — don't unit test them.

## Evaluation

`eval/` contains an end-to-end eval harness. `eval/scenarios.yaml` defines scenarios (fixture + PRD + validation commands). Fixtures in `eval/fixtures/` are plain project files copied into disposable git repos per run. Results are gitignored and auto-pruned. Run `./eval/run.sh --help` or read `eval/run.sh` for usage.

## Conventions

- Use Mermaid diagrams instead of ASCII art in documentation
- SDK imports (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) are restricted to `src/engine/backends/` — agent runners use the `AgentBackend` interface

## Tech decisions

- ESM-only (`"type": "module"`), target Node.js 22+
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is a runtime dependency (externalized from bundle so its `import.meta.url` resolves correctly). Chosen for Max subscription billing (zero API cost). Isolated behind `AgentBackend` interface for future provider swappability.
- tsup bundles to `dist/cli.js` with shebang; SDK is externalized via `external` config to preserve subprocess resolution
- Engine uses `AsyncGenerator<EforgeEvent>` pattern — consumers iterate, no callbacks except clarification/approval
- Clarification uses engine-level events (parsed from agent XML output), not SDK's built-in `AskUserQuestion`
- Langfuse tracing for all agent calls via `src/engine/tracing.ts` (env vars: `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`)
- MCP servers auto-loaded from `.mcp.json` (gitignored, same format as Claude Code). Agents get full tool access to configured servers (brain, langfuse, etc.). Programmatic callers can override via `EforgeEngineOptions.mcpServers`.
- Claude Code plugins auto-discovered from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Provides skills, hooks, and plugin-bundled MCP servers to agents via the SDK's `plugins` option. Configured via `eforge.yaml` `plugins` section. `settingSources: ['project']` enabled by default so agents load CLAUDE.md.

## CLI commands

```
eforge plan <source>      # PRD file or prompt → plan files
eforge run <source>       # Plan + build + validate in one step
eforge build <planSet>    # Execute plans (implement + review + validate)
eforge status             # Check running builds
```

Flags: `--auto` (bypass approval gates), `--verbose` (stream output), `--dry-run` (validate only), `--no-monitor` (disable web monitor), `--no-plugins` (disable plugin loading)

## Roadmap

`docs/roadmap.md` is a high-level vision document for where the project is headed. It captures direction (what and why), not implementation details (how). It will evolve over time as priorities shift.

- **Read it** before proposing new features or architectural changes to ensure alignment with planned direction
- **Keep it lean** — goal + bullet points per section, no code examples, frontmatter specs, or implementation plans
- **Future only** — remove items from the roadmap once they ship. Completed work is documented in the PRD, git history, and CLAUDE.md, not the roadmap.
- **Update it** when direction changes after discussion with the user
- **Don't duplicate it** — implementation details belong in PRDs, plan files, or CLAUDE.md, not the roadmap

The original PRD (`docs/init-prd.md`) is historical context. The roadmap is the current source of truth for future direction.
