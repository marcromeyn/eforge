# /eforge:run

Launch `eforge run` to plan and build from a PRD file or description. This is a thin launcher - all orchestration, agent execution, and state management are handled by the eforge CLI.

**Prerequisite**: `eforge` CLI must be installed and on PATH.

## Arguments

- `source` - PRD file path or inline description of what to build (required unless `--queue`)
- `--queue` - (optional) Process all PRDs from the queue instead of a single source

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Source

**If `--queue` is in arguments:**
Skip source validation. Will process the entire PRD queue.

**Otherwise**, check that `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and the source is readable:

- **File path**: Verify the file exists with the Read tool. Show a brief summary of what it describes.
- **Inline description**: Note that eforge will use this directly as the source prompt.

If no arguments provided:
1. Check the current conversation for a PRD or plan file path from a prior session
2. If found, read it with the Read tool and show a brief summary
3. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding
4. If no file is found in conversation context, suggest running `/eforge:enqueue` first to create a PRD
- **Stop here** if the user declines or no source is identified

### Step 2: Launch

Run eforge as a background task:

```bash
# Normal mode (enqueue + plan + build + validate)
eforge run $SOURCE --auto --verbose

# Queue mode (process all PRDs from the queue)
eforge run --queue --auto --verbose
```

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool call so the user gets notified when the build completes without blocking the conversation.

- `--auto` bypasses approval gates (the user approved by invoking this skill)
- `--verbose` streams detailed output for the completion notification

### Step 3: Monitor

Tell the user:

**For normal mode:**

> Build launched. You'll be notified when it completes.
>
> **Monitor**: http://localhost:4567
>
> The run executes the full lifecycle:
> 1. **Enqueue** - formats and normalizes your source into a structured PRD
> 2. **Profile selection** - analyzes scope to select a workflow profile
> 3. **Planning** - generates plan files from your source
> 4. **Plan review** - blind review of the plan artifacts
> 5. **Building** - implements each plan in parallel on feature branches
> 6. **Code review** - blind code review of the implementation
> 7. **Merging** - merges completed plans back to the base branch
> 8. **Validation** - post-merge review/fix loop (type-check, tests, lint)
> 9. **Squash** - collapses all intermediate commits into a single content commit
>
> Use `/eforge:status` for a quick inline status check.

**For queue mode:**

> Queue processing launched. You'll be notified when it completes.
>
> **Monitor**: http://localhost:4567
>
> Each queued PRD goes through the full lifecycle: enqueue formatting, planning, building, review, merging, and validation.
>
> Use `/eforge:status` for a quick inline status check.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `eforge` not found | Tell user to install eforge CLI and ensure it's on PATH |
| Source file not found | Check path, suggest `/eforge:enqueue` to create one |
| No arguments provided | Check conversation for plan file; if none found, suggest `/eforge:enqueue` |
| Build fails on launch | Show error, check prerequisites |
