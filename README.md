# eforge

You plan, eforge builds - an autonomous plan-build-review CLI that handles the engineering methodology so you can focus on intent.

The name combines **E** from the [Expedition-Excursion-Errand (EEE) methodology](https://www.markschaake.com/posts/expedition-excursion-errand/) with **forge**, reflecting the tool's role in shaping code from plans. eforge assesses your task's scope (errand, excursion, or expedition) and adapts its planning and execution strategy accordingly.

## Status

I built eforge for my professional work and use it daily. The source is public so others can learn from it, adapt it, or fork it. I don't accept pull requests. Issues are welcome for bug reports and questions — I read them, but may not respond or act on them. If you want to take it in a different direction, please fork freely.

## Why eforge?

AI coding tools can produce code fast, but without structure the quality is unpredictable. A single agent that writes and reviews its own work is like a developer merging their own PRs without review - it works sometimes, but there's no systemic quality guarantee.

eforge codifies a methodology that evolved through extensive real-world use with Claude Code - first as hand-crafted skills, then as battle-tested plugins, now as a standalone engine:

1. **Plan** - a detailed, scope-aware planning session with clarification for ambiguities
2. **Implement** - execute the plan, with documentation updates running in parallel
3. **Blind review** - a fresh context reviews the work with zero knowledge of the builder's reasoning
4. **Fix & evaluate** - a fixer agent applies reviewer suggestions, then the evaluator applies per-hunk verdicts - accepting strict improvements while rejecting anything that alters intent
5. **Validate** - verify against the original plan, fix any failures

You bring the "what" and "why." eforge handles the "how" - structured, independent review cycles that produce consistently high-quality results. Plan interactively in Claude Code, then hand off to eforge for build, review, and validation. Agents inherit your project's plugins, skills, and MCP servers automatically, and git worktree isolation makes it safe to run multiple eforge builds in parallel on the same project. The engine is backend-flexible - the sole implementation today uses the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-agent-sdk), but the `AgentBackend` abstraction means it can be extended to support other systems.

    end
```

- **Planning** - The planner explores the codebase, assesses scope (errand = 1 plan, excursion = 2-3, expedition = 4+), asks clarifying questions, and writes plan files. Plans go through a blind review cycle before building starts.
- **Building** - Each plan runs in an isolated git worktree. The builder implements the plan, a blind reviewer proposes fixes in a fresh context, and the evaluator applies per-hunk verdicts - accepting strict improvements while rejecting anything that alters intent.
- **Validation** - Runs configured commands (type-check, tests, linting). If validation fails, a fixer agent attempts minimal repairs automatically.
- **Orchestration** - Multi-plan sets are resolved into a dependency graph, executed in parallel waves, and merged in topological order.

## Getting Started

### Install

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, pnpm, [Claude Max subscription](https://claude.ai/upgrade) (for the Agent SDK backend)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eforge-run/eforge.git
cd eforge
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm link --global
```

### Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

The plugin lets you plan interactively in Claude Code and hand off to eforge for build, review, and validation. It requires the eforge CLI to be installed and on PATH.

Add the marketplace and install from within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add eforge-run/eforge
/plugin install eforge@eforge
```

Once installed, the primary entrypoint is `/eforge:run` - it takes a PRD or prompt and handles planning, building, review, and validation end-to-end.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/eforge:enqueue` | Normalize input and add to queue |
| `/eforge:run` | Enqueue + compile + build + validate in one step |
| `/eforge:status` | Check build progress |
| `/eforge:config` | Initialize or edit `eforge.yaml` with interactive guidance |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Normalize input and add to the PRD queue
eforge enqueue docs/my-feature.md

# Enqueue + compile + build + validate in one step
eforge run docs/my-feature.md
eforge run "Add a health check endpoint"

# Process all PRDs from the queue
eforge run --queue

# Watch queue and process new PRDs as they arrive
eforge run --queue --watch

# Check running builds
eforge status

# List PRDs in the queue
eforge queue list

# Process specific PRD from the queue
eforge queue run my-feature

# Watch queue for new PRDs
eforge queue run --watch

# Validate eforge.yaml configuration
eforge config validate

# Show resolved configuration (all layers merged)
eforge config show

# Start or connect to the monitor dashboard
eforge monitor
```

Each command supports `--help` for the full list of options. Common flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--auto` | Bypass approval gates |
| `--verbose` | Stream agent output |
| `--dry-run` | Validate without executing |
| `--queue` | Process all PRDs from the queue |
| `--watch` | Watch queue for new PRDs (with `--queue`) |
| `--poll-interval <ms>` | Poll interval for watch mode (default 5000) |
| `--no-monitor` | Disable web monitor |
| `--no-plugins` | Disable plugin loading |
| `--generate-profile` | Let the planner generate a custom workflow profile |

## Configuration

eforge is configured via `eforge.yaml` (searched upward from cwd), environment variables, and auto-discovered files.

### `eforge.yaml`

All fields are optional. Defaults are shown:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true               # Auto-discover Claude Code plugins
  # include:                  # Allowlist - only load these (plugin identifiers)
  #   - "git@schaake-cc-marketplace"
  # exclude:                  # Denylist - skip these from auto-discovery
  #   - "ui@schaake-cc-marketplace"
  # paths:                    # Additional local plugin directories
  #   - /path/to/custom-plugin

agents:
  maxTurns: 30                # Max agent turns before stopping
  permissionMode: bypass      # 'bypass' or 'default'
  settingSources:             # Which Claude Code settings to load (user, project, local)
    - project                 # Loads CLAUDE.md and project settings

build:
  parallelism: <cpu-count>    # Max parallel plan executions
  maxValidationRetries: 2     # Fix attempts on validation failure (0 = no retries)
  cleanupPlanFiles: true      # Remove plan files after successful build
  # worktreeDir: /custom/path # Override worktree base directory
  # postMergeCommands:        # Extra validation commands (appended to planner-generated ones)
  #   - "pnpm install"
  #   - "pnpm type-check"
  #   - "pnpm test"

plan:
  outputDir: plans            # Where plan artifacts are written

prdQueue:
  dir: docs/prd-queue          # Where queued PRDs are stored
  autoRevise: false             # Auto-revise PRDs on enqueue
  watchPollIntervalMs: 5000     # Poll interval for --watch mode

langfuse:
  # publicKey: lf_pk_...      # Or set LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY env var
  # secretKey: lf_sk_...      # Or set LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY env var
  host: https://cloud.langfuse.com  # Or set LANGFUSE_BASE_URL env var
```

### MCP Servers

MCP servers are auto-loaded from `.mcp.json` in the project root (same format Claude Code uses). All agents receive the same MCP servers.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["brain-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "BRAIN_DB": "/path/to/db" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Plugins

Plugins are auto-discovered from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Both user-scoped (global) and project-scoped plugins matching the working directory are loaded. Plugins provide skills, hooks, and MCP servers to eforge's agents.

Use `plugins.include`/`plugins.exclude` in `eforge.yaml` to filter, or `--no-plugins` to disable entirely.

### Hooks

Hooks are fire-and-forget shell commands triggered by eforge events - useful for logging, notifications, and external system integration. They do not block or influence the pipeline. See [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md) for configuration, event patterns, and environment variables.

## Architecture

eforge is **library-first**. The engine (`src/engine/`) is a pure TypeScript library that communicates exclusively through typed `EforgeEvent`s via `AsyncGenerator` - it never writes to stdout. The CLI and web monitor are thin consumers that iterate the event stream and render.

Agent runners use the `AgentBackend` interface - all SDK interaction is isolated behind a single adapter (`src/engine/backends/claude-sdk.ts`). New surfaces (CI, TUI, web) consume the same event stream.

A real-time web monitor records all events to SQLite and serves a dashboard over SSE, auto-starting with `run` commands.

## Evaluation

An end-to-end eval harness lives in `eval/`. It runs eforge against embedded fixture projects and validates the output compiles and tests pass.

```bash
./eval/run.sh                        # Run all scenarios
./eval/run.sh todo-api-health-check  # Run one scenario
./eval/run.sh --dry-run              # Smoke-test the harness
```

See `eval/scenarios.yaml` for the scenario manifest and `eval/fixtures/` for the test projects.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Run via tsx (pass args after --)
pnpm build        # Bundle with tsup
pnpm type-check   # Type check
pnpm test         # Run unit tests
```
