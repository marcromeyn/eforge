# Remove Roadmap Skills from Eforge Plugin

## Architecture Context

The eforge plugin bundles roadmap-related skills that don't belong in a plan-build-review tool. This plan removes them to keep the plugin focused on its core purpose.

## Implementation

### Overview

Delete 4 roadmap skill directories and 1 spec file, then update plugin.json (commands, description, version), CLAUDE.md, and docs/roadmap.md to remove all roadmap skill references.

### Key Decisions

1. Bump plugin version to `1.6.0` (minor bump since we're removing features, not breaking the API)
2. Remove the "Remove roadmap skills" bullet from roadmap.md since this work will have shipped

## Scope

### In Scope
- Delete `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-policy/`, `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap/`, `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-init/`, `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-prune/`
- Delete `eforge-plugin/roadmap-skills-spec.md`
- Update `eforge-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: remove 3 roadmap commands, update description, bump version to `1.6.0`
- Update `CLAUDE.md` line 86: remove "roadmap" from the eforge-plugin comment
- Update `docs/roadmap.md` line 34: remove the "Remove roadmap skills" bullet

### Out of Scope
- Moving roadmap skills to a separate plugin (not requested)

## Files

### Delete
- `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-policy/` — Roadmap governance policy skill
- `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap/` — Roadmap management skill
- `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-init/` — Roadmap initialization skill
- `eforge-plugin/skills/roadmap-prune/` — Roadmap pruning skill
- `eforge-plugin/roadmap-skills-spec.md` — Roadmap skills specification

### Modify
- `eforge-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Remove 3 roadmap commands from `commands` array, update `description` to remove "roadmap management" language, bump `version` to `1.6.0`
- `CLAUDE.md` — Change eforge-plugin comment from `(skills for enqueue, run, status, config, roadmap)` to `(skills for enqueue, run, status, config)`
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Remove the "Remove roadmap skills" bullet (line 34)
