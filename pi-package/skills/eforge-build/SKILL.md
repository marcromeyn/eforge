# /eforge:build

Enqueue a PRD file or description for the eforge daemon to build. Uses the eforge tools which communicate with the daemon for orchestration, agent execution, and state management.

## Arguments

- `source` (optional) - PRD file path or inline description of what to build

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Source Input

Determine the working source from one of three branches:

**Branch A — File path**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path (ends in `.md`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, or contains `/`):
1. Verify the file exists with the Read tool
2. Show a brief summary of what it describes
3. Use the **file path** as the source — skip directly to **Step 4**

**Branch B — Inline description**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided but is not a file path:
1. Note the inline description as the working source
2. Proceed to **Step 2**

**Branch C — No arguments**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided:
1. Examine conversation context for intent signals:
   - Recently discussed features or requirements
   - Files the user has been editing or asking about
   - Errors or issues the user has been troubleshooting
   - Goals or tasks the user has stated
2. If context yields a reasonable description, present it: "Based on our conversation, it sounds like you want to build: _{inferred description}_. Is that right?"
   - If the user confirms, use that description as the working source and proceed to **Step 2**
   - If the user corrects, use their correction as the working source and proceed to **Step 2**
3. If no context is available, ask: "What would you like to build? You can provide a description or a path to a PRD file."
   - **Stop here** if the user declines or no source is identified

### Step 2: Assess Completeness

Evaluate the working source against the 5 PRD sections the formatter expects:

| Section | What to look for |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Problem/Motivation** | Why this needs to be built — pain point, gap, or opportunity |
| **Goal** | What the end result should be — the desired outcome |
| **Approach** | How to accomplish it — strategy, patterns, or technical approach |
| **Scope** | Boundaries — what's in and out of scope |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | How to verify it's done — testable conditions |

**Threshold rules:**
- If the working source is **short (~30 words or fewer)**, always proceed to **Step 3** (interview) — short sources benefit from enrichment regardless of apparent coverage
- If the working source covers **3 or more** of the 5 sections, skip to **Step 4** (confirm) — the formatter can handle the remaining gaps
- Otherwise, proceed to **Step 3** (interview) for the missing sections

### Step 3: Interview

Ask about **missing sections only**. Use the question lookup table below to formulate questions. Combine all questions into a **single message** (max 4 questions).

**Question lookup table:**

| Missing section(s) | Question |
|--------------------|----------|
| Problem/Motivation + Goal (both missing) | "What problem are you trying to solve, and what should the end result look like?" |
| Problem/Motivation (alone) | "What's the pain point or gap that motivates this change?" |
| Goal (alone) | "What should the end result look like when this is done?" |
| Approach | "Do you have a preferred approach or technical strategy in mind?" |
| Scope | "Is there anything explicitly out of scope or any boundaries to be aware of?" |
| Acceptance Criteria | "How will you know this is done? Any specific conditions to verify?" |

**Escape hatch**: If the user responds with "just build it", "skip", "go ahead", or any similar signal to decline elaboration, accept the working source as-is and proceed to **Step 4**. The formatter handles missing sections gracefully (fills them with "N/A").

After the user responds, incorporate their answers into the working source and proceed to **Step 4**.

### Step 4: Confirm Source Preview

Call the `eforge_confirm_build` tool with `{ source: "<the complete working source text>" }`. This presents an interactive TUI overlay where the user can review the source (rendered as Markdown) and select confirm, edit, or cancel from a keyboard-navigable list.

For **file path sources** (Branch A from Step 1), pass a brief summary of the file contents as the source text (not the full file), and note the file path in the summary.

The tool returns a JSON object with a `choice` field. Handle each value:

- **`"confirm"`** - Proceed to **Step 5**
- **`"edit"`** - Ask the user what they'd like to revise, incorporate their changes, then call `eforge_confirm_build` again with the updated source
- **`"cancel"`** - Acknowledge the cancellation and stop

### Step 5: Enqueue & Report

First, validate the project config by calling the `eforge_config` tool with `{ action: "validate" }`.

- If `valid` is `false`, display the errors and stop:
  > **Config validation failed:**
  >
  > _{list each error}_
  >
  > Fix your config with `/eforge:config` and try again.

  **Do not proceed to enqueue.**

- If `valid` is `true`, continue silently.

Call the `eforge_build` tool with `{ source: "<source>" }`.

The tool returns a JSON response with a `sessionId` and `autoBuild` status.

After successful enqueue, tell the user:

> PRD enqueued (session: `{sessionId}`). The daemon will auto-build.
>
> The daemon formats your source into a PRD, selects a workflow profile, then compiles and builds. The pipeline varies by profile — errands skip straight to building, while excursions and expeditions go through planning and plan review first. Every profile gets blind code review (a separate agent with no builder context), merge, and post-merge validation.
>
> Use `/eforge:status` for a quick inline status check.

If the monitor is running, also include the monitor URL.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Source file not found | Check path, suggest alternatives |
| No arguments and no context available | Ask the user what they want to build |
| User cancels at confirmation | Acknowledge and stop |
| Tool returns error | Show the error message from the daemon response |
| Config validation fails | Show errors, suggest fixing config, do not enqueue |
| Daemon connection failure | The daemon auto-starts; if it still fails, suggest running `eforge daemon start` manually |
